# TGS_UnityGame - GST_UnityGame
# Description:
--------BATISISTEMAS----------
This is a unity game based on a popular Unity's character mostly used in rookie games, basically we took this main character and we put him a underworld setting fully populated by bats and why not robots :).
Entire game is about GST (General Systems Theory) so when you approach a bat he will ask you a question to which you can answer if it is true or false, if you answer correctly you earn 1 EXP point, if you answer wrong you lose 1 HP point. The game ends if you get 5 EXP points or lose all 5 HP points.
It is a very simple game but I hope you find it entertaining.
GOOD LUCK!

# Errors and bugs

- Almost at the end, probably you will find a bat but it's not going to ask you anything.
